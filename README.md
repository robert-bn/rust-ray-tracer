# ray_tracer

A simple raytracer based on the design described in [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley.

This is currently a work in process, but below is an example rendering of a simple scene showing diffuse and reflective spheres using the raytracer.
